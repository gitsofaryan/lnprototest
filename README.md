lnprototest is a set of test helpers written in Python3, designed to make it easy to write new tests when you propose changes to the lightning network protocol, as well as test existing implementations.

## Install requirements

To install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install poetry
poetry shell
poetry install
```

## Running test

The simplest way to run is with the "dummy" runner:

```bash
make check
```

Here are some other useful pytest options:
1. `-n8` to run 8-way parallel.
2. `-x` to stop on the first failure.
3. `--pdb` to enter the debugger on first failure.
4. `--trace` to enter the debugger on every test.
5. `-k foo` to only run tests with 'foo' in their name.
6. `tests/test_bolt1-01-init.py` to only run tests in that file.
7. `tests/test_bolt1-01-init.py::test_init` to only run that test.
8. `--log-cli-level={LEVEL_NAME}` to enable the logging during the test execution.

### Running Against A Real Node.

The more useful way to run is to use an existing implementation. So far, core-lightning is supported. You will need:

1. `bitcoind` installed, and in your path.
2. [`lightningd`](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/) compiled with `--enable-debugbuild` (Note: not `--enable-developer` as that flag has been renamed). By default the source directory should be `../lightning` relative to this directory, otherwise use `export LIGHTNING_SRC=dirname`.

Then you can run:

```bash
make check PYTEST_ARGS='--runner=lnprototest.clightning.Runner'
```

or directly:

```bash
pytest --runner=lnprototest.clightning.Runner
```

## Setup with LDK

For testing with the Lightning Development Kit (LDK), follow these steps (contributed by Prakhar Saxena, LDK maintainer):

1. Ensure Bitcoin Core 23.0 is installed and in your path.
2. Create a work directory (e.g., `WORKDIR`) and clone both `lnprototest` and Prakharâ€™s LDK-Sample fork:
   ```bash
   mkdir WORKDIR
   cd WORKDIR
   git clone https://github.com/rustyrussell/lnprototest.git
   git clone https://github.com/Psycho-Pirate/ldk-sample.git
   ```
   Your structure should look like:
   ```
   WORKDIR/
     - lnprototest/
     - ldk-sample/
   ```

3. Build LDK-Sample:
   ```bash
   cd ldk-sample
   cargo build
   ```

4. Add `lnprototest` to your Python path:
   ```bash
   cd ../lnprototest
   export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/WORKDIR/lnprototest"
   ```
   (Replace `/path/to/WORKDIR` with your actual path, e.g., `/home/user/WORKDIR`.)

5. Run tests with LDK:
   ```bash
   cd ../ldk-sample/Lnprototest_Testing
   pip3 install poetry
   poetry install
   poetry run pytest /path/to/WORKDIR/lnprototest/tests --runner=ldk_lnprototest.Runner --log-cli-level=DEBUG
   ```
   (Replace `/path/to/WORKDIR` with your actual path.)

Let's keep the sats flowing!
