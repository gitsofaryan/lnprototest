# API Refactoring Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED: Minimal Lightning Network Protocol API

The Lightning Network protocol API has been successfully refactored according to Vincent's specifications for minimalism and focus.

## What Was Changed

### 🗑️ Removed (Over-engineered components):
- **File**: `websocket_runner.py` (deleted)
- **Endpoints**: `/health`, `/api/node-info`, `/api/connect`, `/api/raw-msg`
- **Classes**: `WebSocketRunner` (complex state management)
- **Functions**: Multiple helper functions, complex message handling
- **State**: `active_sequences`, `active_connections` tracking
- **Imports**: Unnecessary dependencies and complex decorators

### ✅ Added (Minimal implementation):
- **Endpoints**: Only `/connect` and `/rawmsg` (exactly 2 as specified)
- **WebSocket**: Direct integration into `app.py` for real-time broadcasting
- **Sequence**: Vincent's exact 7-step protocol handshake in `/connect`
- **Broadcasting**: Simple message broadcasting for visualization
- **Testing**: `test_minimal_api.py` for validation

## Current API Structure

```
/connect (POST)  → Vincent's 7-step protocol sequence
/rawmsg (POST)   → Send single raw message
WebSocket        → Real-time message broadcasting
```

## File Structure

```
api/
├── app.py               ← Single file implementation (minimal)
├── readme.md            ← Updated documentation
├── test_minimal_api.py  ← Testing script
└── __pycache__/         ← Python cache
```

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Vincent's Exact Sequence** in `/connect`:
   - Connect to node 03
   - Expect init message
   - Send init with global features
   - Disconnect
   - Connect to node 02
   - Expect init message
   - Send init with additional features [99]

2. **Real-time WebSocket Broadcasting**:
   - All protocol events broadcasted instantly
   - Message format includes step, direction, event type, data
   - Perfect for visualization frontend

3. **Single Raw Message Sending** via `/rawmsg`:
   - Accepts any Lightning Network message type
   - Broadcasts the message via WebSocket
   - Returns success confirmation

## Vincent's Requirements ✅

- ✅ **Minimal implementation** (single file)
- ✅ **Only 2 endpoints** (/connect, /rawmsg)
- ✅ **Real-time WebSocket** communication
- ✅ **Exact protocol sequence** implementation
- ✅ **Focused and clean** architecture
- ✅ **No over-engineering** or unnecessary complexity

## How to Use

1. **Start the API**:
   ```bash
   cd lnprototest
   python api/app.py
   ```

2. **Test the endpoints**:
   ```bash
   python api/test_minimal_api.py
   ```

3. **Connect to WebSocket** for real-time updates at `ws://localhost:5000`

## Architecture Benefits

- **Single file**: All logic in `app.py` - easy to understand and maintain
- **Direct WebSocket**: No separate runner - messages broadcast immediately
- **Minimal dependencies**: Only essential libraries
- **Clear separation**: Two distinct functions, no overlap
- **Real-time visualization**: Perfect for frontend integration

The API is now exactly what Vincent requested: minimal, focused, and designed for protocol correctness with real-time visualization capabilities.
